# Combination-Lock

 This project aims to identify the minimum
 number of steps needed to unlock a combination lock given its initial and unlocked final
 value.
 
It applies Python, C, and Assembly programming and profiling algorithm to compare the performance of Python and C-written codes.
 
The program receives three numbers denoting the number of combination locks 𝑁, the initial configuration of the lock S, and the unlock configuration E respectively.
It outputs the minimum number of steps needed to change the lock
 from its initial to the final unlock configuration.
